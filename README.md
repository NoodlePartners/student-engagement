Student Engagement

This is a Sakai app that provides a metric for student engagement based on site activity.

There are two parts:

1. The data collection job
2. The API to build and retrieve the data

## Building
Simply `mvn clean install sakai:deploy` into your Sakai installation.

## Configuration
In sakai.properties, set the values for each of the events you want to be considered. You can use either of the configuration formats below. Each entry must have a `:` between the event name and the value. Decimal values are supported.

````
student.engagement.event.values=annc.read:5,asn.read.assignment:10,asn.save.submission:20.3
````
OR

````
student.engagement.event.values.count=3
student.engagement.event.values.1=annc.read:5
student.engagement.event.values.2=asn.read.assignment:10
student.engagement.event.values.3=asn.save.submission:20.3
````

In Sakai, login as an administrator and navigate to the Admin Workspace > Job Scheduler. 
Setup the `Student Engagement SCore Calculator` job to run once per day.

__This job must only run once per day!__

## How the scoring works
Every event that is generated by a user for the last complete and entire day in their local timezone, _before_ the day that the job runs, is collected. If any event matches the configured set, the score will be added. A total score will be created and saved for the student in each site and for the day in their local timezone. If the day is not complete, the previous day's set of events will be used.

If a user has no events for the day, their score will be 0 for that day.
